# Monk

![](icon.png)

## TL;DR

Monk is a photo focussed static site generator.

## Tell me more!

Written in Haxe but eventually usuable for more languages.

**Why Monk?** Writing a website like this is complex and slower then CMS, so it feld a little like the old European Monk copying books.
But they are not as cool as Shaulin Monks so there might be some references to those monks.

## summary

- [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org) The Cross-platform Toolkit for transpiling to javascript [more](READ_HAXE.MD)
- [Bootstrap v4.0.0](https://getbootstrap.com/) for css framework
- [Fontawesome v5](https://fontawesome.com) for nice icons
- [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS with superpowers
- [LiveReload chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)
- [Neko webserver](README_NEKO.MD) is a Haxe related web server, but any server should works

## more stuff to install

## WIP

I use this to generate the homepage of [matthijskamstra.nl](http://www.matthijskamstra.nl).

This fixes a very specific need I have, not fixed by others generators. That doesn't mean they aren't good, just not in this case.

I use a quick and dirty approach to get stuff done. Not readable, might change in the future.
The more I work on it, the better it will become.




## sources

This first "hit" I got was Expose, so Monk is heavily inspired by the work of Jack Qiao

- <https://github.com/Jack000/Expose>

I have work on and with Butterfly before and because of that I use a lot from that generator:

## folder structure


```
+ folder
	- config.json
	+ img
	+ pages
	+ photo
	+ post
	+ theme0
	+ www
		- index.html
		- about.html
		- contact.html
		- why.html
		+ img
		+ pages
		+ photo
			+ foobar1
			+ foobar2
			+ foobar3
		+ post
		+ theme0
```


## folders read

- post folder only that folder...
- pages folder only that folder
- photos folder and one folder deeper

```
+ photos
	+ folder00
	+ folder01
	+ folder02
```

## tools

- <https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php>

## Usage

Currently I am only using Monk via haxelib

```bash
haxelib run monk
haxelib run monk generate
```

That might change to

- command line
- nodejs
- and other target by Haxe


### Config


```
{
	"site_title":"MONK",
	"social_button":false,
	"theme_dir":"theme0",
	"any_var_you":"want_to_use"
}
```



## reminder!

the folder sorted as first (either `alpha` or `00_zebra`) wil be the first images you will see on the homepage!

### sort photo folders

how to sort folders

create folder with `00` -> `99`  and add `_` to use default folder sort.

example:
```
	+ 00_ccc
	+ 01_bbb
	+ 03_aaa
```

will create the photo menu

```
	+ ccc
	+ bbb
	+ aaa
```


### Meta-data

because I didn't want to show metadata in the export/preview of markdown, the meta-data is wrapped in comment `<!-- ... -->`

```html
<!--
meta-id: aa
meta-title: ShortTitle
meta-date: 10-10-2016
meta-tags: foo, bar, test, json
meta-order: 1
-->
```

#### Post and Pages

metadata for both pages and post

- id: an uniq value, will be generated by MONK
- title: a short/menu title

#### Pages

metdate used to sort pages in navigation

- order: used for pages sorting

#### Post

metadata for posts

- date: publish date (used for sorting)
- tags: categories where the post/page to belongs



# Help

`haxelib run monk help`

```
how to use:
haxelib run monk [action] [options]

	[action]:
		scaffold 	: generate a folder structure with basic helper files
		generate	: generate static site
		clear		: cleanup www folder
		update		: update/overwrite default "theme0" folder

	[options]
		-force 		: overwrite existing files
		-optim 		: use jpg optimization

```




### Ignore folder/files

Folders or files you want to ignore, prefix with an `_` or `.`

Rename folder `foo` to `_foo` and it will be ignored.
The same will happen with files: rename `test.md` to `_test.md` and it will not be used by MONK.
