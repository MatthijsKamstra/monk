# Monk

![](icon.png)

## TL;DR

Monk is a photo focussed static site generator.

## Tell me more!

Written in Haxe but eventually usuable for more languages.

**Why Monk?** Writing a website like this is complex and slower then CMS, so it feld a little like the old European Monk copying books.
But they are not as cool as Shaulin Monks so there might be some references to those monks.

## WIP

I use this to generate the homepage of [matthijskamstra.nl](http://www.matthijskamstra.nl).

This fixes a very specific need I have, not fixed by others generators. That doesn't mean they aren't good, just not in this case.

I use a quick and dirty approach to get stuff done. Not readable, might change in the future.
The more I work on it, the better it will become.

## sources

This first "hit" I got was Expose, so Monk is heavily inspired by the work of Jack Qiao
- <https://github.com/Jack000/Expose>

I have work on and with Butterfly before and because of that I use a lot from that generator:

## folder structure


```
+ folder
	- config.json
	+ pages
	+ photo
	+ post
	+ theme0
	+ www
```


## folders read

- post folder only that folder...
- pages folder only that folder
- photos folder and one folder deeper

```
+ photos
	+ folder00
	+ folder01
	+ folder02
```

## tools

## Usage

Currently I am only using Monk via haxelib

```bash
haxelib run monk
haxelib run monk generate
```

That might change to

- command line
- nodejs
- and other target by Haxe


### Config


### Meta-data


### Tips

Folders or files you want to ignore, prefix with an `_` or `.`

Rename folder `foo` to `_foo` and it will be ignored.
The same will happen with files: rename `test.md` to `_test.md` and it will not be used be MONK.
